# Data Analytics Portfolio  
**SQL • Python (EDA) • Power BI**

This repository showcases three end-to-end data analytics projects completed as part of my hands-on internship experience.  
Each project focuses on a different stage of the analytics workflow — **querying data, exploring patterns, and visualizing insights for decision-making**.

Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to work with structured datasets, apply analytical thinking, and communicate insights clearly using industry-relevant tools.

## Tech Stack

- **SQL** – Data querying, joins, aggregations, subqueries, analytical logic  
- **Python** – pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards, KPIs, filters, and visual storytelling  
- **Tools** – Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, PowerPoint (insight presentation)

##  Projects Overview

### 1️. SQL Case Study: Business Queries & Insights

**Objective:**  
Solve real-world business-style questions using SQL to extract meaningful insights from relational datasets.

**What I worked on:**
- Answered **15 analytical SQL questions**
- Used:
  - INNER and LEFT JOINs  
  - Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)  
  - Subqueries  
  - Filtering and grouping logic  
- Focused on translating business questions into efficient SQL queries

**Key takeaways:**
- Strengthened logical thinking and query structuring
- Improved understanding of relational data and dependencies
- Learned how small query optimizations impact clarity and performance

 *This project reflects my ability to think analytically using only raw tables and SQL logic.*

### 2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employee Mental Health Dataset

**Objective:**  
Analyze employee mental health data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships that can inform organizational decision-making.

**What I worked on:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Feature-wise and demographic analysis
- Visualizations using histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and heatmaps
- Interpreting patterns related to:
  - Age distribution 
  - Treatment status  
  - Work interference  
  - Support systems and mental health outcomes

**Key takeaways:**
- Developed a structured EDA workflow
- Learned to ask the *right analytical questions* before visualizing
- Improved data storytelling by connecting visuals to real-world implications


 *This project highlights my ability to move beyond plots and focus on insight-driven analysis.*

### 3️. Power BI Dashboard: Agriculture Insights

**Objective:**  
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize agricultural data and derive insights useful for stakeholders such as policymakers, analysts, and agribusiness decision-makers.

**What I worked on:**
- Data modeling and transformation
- Designing KPIs and summary metrics
- Creating interactive visuals with slicers and filters
- Analyzing:
  - Crop distribution  
  - Seasonal trends  
  - Regional patterns  
  - Productivity and impact indicators
